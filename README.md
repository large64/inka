#Database
Sqlite is a well-known lightweight software library that helps you with the managing of databases. For command-line interface, download sqlite3 from [here](http://sqlite.org/download.html). To see what is happening, you may want to use a software with GUI, like sqliteman for Linux, or sqlitebrowser for Windows from [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases)

##Default database
To make default database work while using the software, make sure you have downloaded the default db-dump from [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11975339/Inka.db). If it is done, copy the db file into the root of your project (so the Inka directory will have files like *build.xml, Inka.db, manifest.mf* etc.).
